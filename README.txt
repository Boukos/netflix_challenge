1. preprocessing contains all files/programs for preprocessing
    a. avg_rating.jar and preprocessing_stats.jar were created from files in this package
2. si_matrix contains the two files containing the complete si_matrix, which maps a (movieid, userid) pair to an SI value
3. overall_avg.txt, avg_movie_ratings.txt, and avg_user_ratings.txt are pretty self explanatory.
4. stats.txt contains the results of running preprocessing_stats.jar on the training data. This maps a movieid -> (numSI, sumSI) pair.
